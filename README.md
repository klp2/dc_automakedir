# dc_automakedir - Damian Conway's auto directory creation vim plugin.

Originally downloaded from https://www.bit.do/VAPIDE.

# Why?

To make it easier for me to integrate Damian's work with the other work
that I've mostly borrowed from other people.

# What it does

When editing a new file, if the directory structure doesn't alread exist, vim will
prompt you to create it.
